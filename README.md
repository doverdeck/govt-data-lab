# govt-data-lab'
The data chose interested me because I personally find how the government spends tax payer dollars on different companies interesting as government bailouts and shady deals occur in greater frequency after events such as the 2008 housing market crash and the COVID Recession. My info showed the frequency at which the government funded or subisidized to distributing information and cultural products or NAICS 51 companies in the USA based off of employee count. I chose that certain column because was interested to see what type's of companies the government would invest in based off of how much people and therefore how big they were and to see if it revealed any causation betweeen size of a company and investement. As shown by the frequency graph the most frequent investment was in companies that listed their employee count to be "100 to 249". This reveals that the government favors investing in smaller companies, with the smaller number count of employees being the highest in frequency overall. It may also shows that their are a greater amount of small data companies with 100 to 249 employees than the massive 25,000 to 49,999 employee companies. Later on I might want to find the amount the government gives to each of the companies as the government most likely gives more money to the larger corporations.
